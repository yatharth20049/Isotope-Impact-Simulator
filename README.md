# Isotope Impact Simulator 🌍⚛️

**Isotope Impact Simulator** is a web-based educational platform designed to make learning about isotopes engaging and interactive. It goes beyond nuclear power to explore real-world applications of isotopes in **medicine, agriculture, industry, and space technology**.  

## 🚀 Problem Statement  
- **Limited Awareness**: Most people only associate isotopes with nuclear energy.  
- **No Interactive Comparison**: There is a lack of engaging tools to explore the economic and environmental impacts of isotopes.  

## 🎯 Our Goal  
To bridge the knowledge gap through an **interactive simulation platform** that allows users to explore, compare, and understand isotope applications in real-world scenarios.
